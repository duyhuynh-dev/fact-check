# Zionism: Historical Facts vs. Conspiracy Theories

## What is Zionism?

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel. The movement was a response to centuries of persecution and antisemitism in Europe.

## Historical Facts

Zionism began as a legitimate nationalist movement, similar to other nationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. The first Zionist Congress was held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, organized by Theodor Herzl.

The Balfour Declaration of 1917 expressed British support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people."

The State of Israel was established in 1948 following a United Nations partition plan and the end of the British Mandate.

## Distinguishing Facts from Conspiracy Theories

### Factual Claims About Zionism

- Zionism is a political movement advocating for a Jewish homeland
- The movement has historical roots in Jewish connection to the land of Israel
- Many Jews support Zionism, but not all Jews are Zionists
- Zionism has diverse political and religious interpretations

### Antisemitic Conspiracy Theories About Zionism

Antisemitic conspiracy theories often distort Zionism by:
- Claiming "Zionists" control governments, media, or finance globally
- Using "Zionist" as a code word for "Jew" in conspiracy theories
- Claiming all Jews are part of a "Zionist conspiracy"
- Blaming "Zionists" for world events or conflicts

These conspiracy theories are antisemitic because they:
- Use classic antisemitic tropes (global control, secret cabals)
- Hold Jews collectively responsible
- Use coded language to target Jews

## Important Distinctions

Criticism of specific Israeli policies or the Israeli government is NOT antisemitic. However, using "Zionist" as a code word for Jews or claiming a "Zionist conspiracy" controls the world IS antisemitic.
