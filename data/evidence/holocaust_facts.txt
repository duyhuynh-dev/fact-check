# Holocaust Facts and Historical Information

## Basic Facts

The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945. The Holocaust is also referred to as the Shoah.

The Holocaust occurred during World War II, primarily in German-occupied territories across Europe. The systematic killing began in 1941 with the invasion of the Soviet Union, though persecution of Jews began earlier with the rise of the Nazi party in 1933.

## Key Historical Facts

The Holocaust was not a spontaneous event but a carefully planned and executed genocide. The "Final Solution" was the Nazi plan to systematically murder all Jews in Europe.

Concentration camps and extermination camps were established throughout German-occupied Europe. Major extermination camps included Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno, and Majdanek.

The Holocaust targeted not only Jews but also Roma, Sinti, disabled individuals, political dissidents, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others deemed "undesirable" by the Nazi regime. However, the systematic murder of Jews was the primary focus.

## Denial and Distortion

Holocaust denial is the attempt to negate the established facts of the Holocaust. This includes denying that the Holocaust occurred, minimizing the number of victims, or claiming it was not systematic.

Holocaust inversion refers to inappropriately comparing contemporary events or policies to the Holocaust, such as comparing Israeli policies to Nazi Germany. This is considered antisemitic as it trivializes the Holocaust and uses it as a weapon against Jews.
