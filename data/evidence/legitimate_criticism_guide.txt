# Guide: Legitimate Criticism of Israel vs. Antisemitism

## The Core Distinction

The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism provides clear guidance: "Criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."

## Legitimate Criticism (NOT Antisemitic)

Legitimate criticism focuses on specific policies, actions, or government decisions without using antisemitic tropes. Examples include:

### Policy Criticism
- "Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank violates international law"
- "The Israeli government's approach to Palestinian rights is problematic"
- "Netanyahu's policies are too right-wing"

### Military Criticism
- "The IDF's use of force in Gaza is disproportionate"
- "Israeli military actions have caused excessive civilian casualties"
- "The blockade of Gaza is harmful to civilians"

### Political Criticism
- "Israel should end the occupation"
- "The Israeli government should negotiate with Palestinians"
- "Israel's treatment of Palestinian citizens is discriminatory"

These are political opinions about Israeli policies and actions. They may be harsh, but they are NOT antisemitic.

## Antisemitism (IS Antisemitic)

Antisemitism occurs when criticism of Israel:
- Uses antisemitic tropes (global control, dual loyalty, etc.)
- Holds all Jews responsible for Israel's actions
- Compares Israeli policy to the Holocaust
- Uses coded language or conspiracy theories
- Applies double standards to Israel

### Examples of Antisemitic Criticism

- "Jews control the media to support Israel" → Uses global control trope
- "All Jews are responsible for Palestine" → Collective guilt
- "Israel is like Nazi Germany" → Holocaust inversion
- "The Rothschilds control Israel" → Conspiracy theory
- "Jews have dual loyalty" → Dual loyalty trope

## Key Principles

1. **Focus on Policies, Not People**: Legitimate criticism targets policies, actions, or government decisions, not Jews as a people.

2. **No Tropes**: Legitimate criticism does not use antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories.

3. **No Collective Guilt**: Legitimate criticism does not hold all Jews responsible for Israel's actions.

4. **No Holocaust Inversion**: Legitimate criticism does not compare Israeli policy to the Holocaust.

5. **Consistent Standards**: Legitimate criticism applies the same standards to Israel as to other countries.
