The modern State of Israel was established in 1948 following a United Nations partition plan (UN Resolution 181) that divided the British Mandate of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. This was a legal, internationally recognized process, not a "conquest" or illegal seizure of land.

The Balfour Declaration of 1917 was a public statement by the British government expressing support for a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. It was a diplomatic document, not a secret agreement or conspiracy. The declaration was made during World War I and was part of public diplomatic correspondence.

Jewish migration to Palestine/Israel occurred in multiple waves (aliyah) throughout the 20th century. This included refugees from the Holocaust, Jews fleeing persecution in Arab countries, and others seeking to build a Jewish homeland. This migration was not part of a conspiracy but a response to persecution and the legitimate desire for self-determination.

The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is a complex geopolitical issue with legitimate grievances on both sides. However, framing it as solely the fault of "Zionists" or attributing "every drop of innocent blood" to one side is a form of antisemitic rhetoric that demonizes Jews and Jewish self-determination.

The Jewish Agency was a legitimate organization established in 1929 to represent Jewish interests in Palestine. It worked within the framework of international law and British Mandate regulations. It was not a "spying organization" or secret network.

Claims about Zionist organizations engaging in widespread spying, surveillance, phone tapping, and document theft are antisemitic conspiracy theories with no basis in documented fact. These echo historical antisemitic tropes about Jewish secret networks.

The establishment of Israel involved complex historical processes including the Holocaust, British colonial policies, Arab-Jewish tensions, and international diplomacy. It was not the result of a single "Zionist conspiracy" or secret plot.

Zionism is a legitimate nationalist movement that emerged in the late 19th century, similar to other nationalist movements of that era. It sought to establish a Jewish homeland in response to centuries of persecution and antisemitism in Europe.

The term "Holy Land" refers to a region that is sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The conflict there involves complex historical, religious, and political factors that cannot be reduced to simple narratives of blame or conspiracy.

International recognition of Israel came from the United Nations and many countries worldwide. This was based on legal and diplomatic processes, not secret agreements or conspiracies.
