# Israel/Palestine Historical Context

## Historical Background

The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has deep historical roots dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Understanding this context is important for fact-checking claims about the region.

## Key Historical Facts

The State of Israel was established in 1948 following a United Nations partition plan. The establishment of Israel led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, an event known as the Nakba (catastrophe) to Palestinians.

The 1967 Six-Day War resulted in Israel occupying the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. These territories remain under Israeli control, though Gaza is now under Hamas control.

## Legitimate Criticism vs. Antisemitism

### Legitimate Criticism of Israel (NOT Antisemitic)

Legitimate criticism focuses on specific policies, actions, or government decisions. Examples include:
- Criticism of Israeli settlement policy in the West Bank
- Criticism of Israeli military actions
- Criticism of specific Israeli government policies
- Calls for ending the occupation
- Support for Palestinian rights

These are political opinions and are protected speech. They are NOT antisemitic.

### Antisemitism Related to Israel (IS Antisemitic)

Antisemitism occurs when criticism of Israel:
- Uses antisemitic tropes (e.g., "Jews control the media to support Israel")
- Holds all Jews responsible for Israel's actions
- Compares Israeli policy to the Holocaust
- Uses coded language or conspiracy theories
- Questions the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state (in certain contexts)

## Important Distinctions

The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism provides guidance on distinguishing legitimate criticism from antisemitism. Criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country is not antisemitic. However, applying double standards to Israel, denying its right to exist, or using antisemitic tropes in the context of Israel is antisemitic.
